## Background
Learning React was the main motivation for this project. I gained an understanding of the basics building some little demo apps and wanted to apply what I'd learned to something more complete and polished. I've been building towards working with the MERN stack for some time and the R was the last letter to add to the equation, having worked with M, E, and N before.

I had the idea for a blog quite a while ago, before I took some time to go travelling in 2022. I had thought it would be a fun project to build a blog that I could update on my travels. Having returned home, the original purpose of the blog had obviously expired, but as a goal to aim for so that I could learn about React and the MERN stack, it was right on time. The time spent and the lessons learned from creating the blog were the goal, rather than the blog itself. I won't be writing anything meaningful on the blog, I'll just use placeholder text.

Anyone can create a new post - feel free.

## Nice-to-haves
I'm always trying to learn and improve as a programmer, and there are decisions to be made about where time is best spent to achieve that aim. There were ideas that I had along the way that I would love to add, but adding them might offer a diminished return for my learning compared to starting a new project. I've gathered the ideas here to make sure I don't forget them.
